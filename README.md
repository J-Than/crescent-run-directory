# Crescent Run Resident Directory

Crescent Run Resident Directory is an online, searchable website to help residents of the Crescent Run community find their neighbors within the community.

## Compatibility

The app should run on standard web browsers.

## Usage

This web app is intended for residents of the Crescent Run community, so that they can better get to know their neighbors. It includes the capability to list names, lot numbers, and pet names for each resident or household. It can also have photographs uploaded to help "put a name with a face."

The design of the website is intended to be fairly intuitive, with the primary functionality being the search capability. It permits searching by one of three criteria: resident name, lot number, or pet name. In the case of resident or pet names, it will return partial matches and is case-insensitive. In the case of lot numbers, it will return exact matches only.

The "admin" section of the site, behind a password wall, allows for adding new residents to the directory.

## Roadmap

Future planned improvements include an interactive map and a better display of directory listings.

The website will not be publicly available until a password system has been implemented to protect the privacy of residents.
